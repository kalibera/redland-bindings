Description: Provides methods to parse, query and serialize information
    stored in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is described at <https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/>.
    This package supports RDF by implementing an R interface to the Redland RDF C library,
    described at <http://librdf.org/docs/api/index.html>. In brief, RDF provides a structured graph
    consisting of Statements composed of Subject, Predicate, and Object Nodes.
